    Resolve mutually exclusive seed and generator arguments.

    Args:
        seed: Optional integer seed; mutually exclusive with ``generator``.
        generator: Optional caller-supplied RNG; mutually exclusive with ``seed``.
        device: Device the seeded generator is bound to when ``seed`` is given.

    Returns:
        ``generator`` when supplied; a fresh ``Generator(device).manual_seed(seed)`` when only
            ``seed`` is given; ``None`` (ambient RNG) when neither is given.

    Raises:
